# 📊 Heart Disease Prediction Analysis – Power BI Dashboard  

## 🔍 Overview  
This **Power BI dashboard** provides an in-depth analysis of heart disease risk factors, patient distribution, cholesterol levels, and other key health metrics. The goal is to help visualize patterns and trends in heart disease prevalence using real-world data.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Total Patient Analysis** – Displays total number of patients and percentage diagnosed with heart disease.  
✅ **Cholesterol & Heart Rate Insights** – Analyzes cholesterol levels and maximum heart rate by age group.  
✅ **Heart Disease Risk Segmentation** – Visualizes heart disease risk based on chest pain type, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels.  
✅ **Dynamic Filtering** – Users can filter data by **Sex, Age Group, and BP Category** for deeper insights.  
✅ **EKG & Blood Pressure Analysis** – Tracks heart disease patterns based on EKG results and blood pressure fluctuations.  

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/heart-disease-prediction  
- **Records:** 270 patient entries  
- **Attributes:** Age, Cholesterol, Max Heart Rate, Chest Pain Type, EKG Results, and more  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Power BI** – For data visualization and dashboard creation  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – For calculated measures and KPIs  
- **Power Query** – For data transformation and cleaning  

## 📌 How to Use  
- Download the **Heart Disease Prediction.pbix** file.  
- Open it in **Power BI Desktop**.  
- Interact with filters and visualizations to explore insights.  



## 📖 Insights & Findings
